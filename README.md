### Setup
If you don't have python Postgre-SQL on your OS, follow the steps here --> http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html to install it. You may need to install Homebrew or macports on MacOS to get it, else yum/apt-get should suffice. 

Next, make sure you are running python 2.7. You can use pip to change versions if need be.
